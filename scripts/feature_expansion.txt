# Feature Expansion List for Post-Facto Coding Review MVP

This document outlines additional features that can be implemented primarily through prompt engineering and minor UI changes, leveraging the existing HIPAA-compliant pipeline. Each feature builds on the current workflow: file upload → PHI removal → text extraction → LLM analysis → suggested codes output.

---

## 1. Documentation quality checks
- **Description:** The system will analyze clinical notes for missing elements that could justify higher-value codes (e.g., exam components, time documentation, HPI details).  
- **Implementation:** Extend the LLM prompt to request:  
  *“Identify any missing documentation that may prevent billing at a higher level. Provide suggestions for improving documentation.”*  
- **Output:** List of missing or incomplete sections with actionable guidance.

---

## 2. Denial risk predictor (basic)
- **Description:** Highlight codes that may be at risk of denial if documentation is insufficient.  
- **Implementation:** Extend the LLM prompt to request:  
  *“For each billed and suggested code, list common payer denial reasons and whether the note addresses them.”*  
- **Output:** Table of codes with “Denial Risk: Low/Medium/High” and justification.

---

## 3. Under-coding dashboard (per note level)
- **Description:** Compare billed codes against suggested codes and quantify potential lost revenue.  
- **Implementation:** Prompt the LLM to compute RVUs or relative reimbursement differences.  
- **Output:**  
  - “Billed codes: … (Total RVUs = X)”  
  - “Suggested codes: … (Total RVUs = Y)”  
  - “Potential missed revenue = (Y − X) RVUs”  
- **UI:** Add a summary widget at the bottom of each review report.

## 4. Modifier suggestions
- **Description:** Suggest when modifiers (e.g., -25, -59) are applicable to support reimbursement for multiple procedures on the same day.  
- **Implementation:** Extend the LLM prompt:  
  *“Identify if modifiers should be added to the billed/suggested CPT codes based on documentation.”*  
- **Output:** Suggested CPT + modifier combination with justification.

---

## 5. Audit log / compliance export
- **Description:** Generate a structured report that captures all coding suggestions and their justifications for audit purposes.  
- **Implementation:** Format LLM output into a downloadable PDF or CSV.  
- **Output:**  
  - Suggested codes  
  - Justification text with references to relevant sections of the chart  
  - Time-stamped metadata (provider, patient ID anonymized, date processed)  

---

## 6. Charge capture reminders
- **Description:** Detect services documented in the clinical note that do not have a corresponding CPT/ICD code.  
- **Implementation:** Extend the LLM prompt:  
  *“Identify clinically significant services or procedures documented but not linked to any billing codes. Suggest the appropriate code(s).”*  
- **Output:** List of “uncaptured services” with suggested codes.

---

## Development Notes
- All features are prompt-driven and do not require new external data sources or EHR integration.  
- Outputs should be formatted consistently (tables or structured YAML/JSON) to facilitate downstream use.  
- Compliance and security (PHI redaction, encryption) follow the existing workflow.
