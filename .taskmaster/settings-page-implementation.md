# Settings & Profile Pages Implementation

**Created:** October 3, 2025
**Status:** Planning
**Priority:** High

## Overview

Implement user settings page (`/settings`) with Profile and Preferences tabs, while keeping billing functionality in the existing `/subscription` page.

---

## Track 1: Backend API - User Profile Management ✅ COMPLETE

### 1.1 Review Existing User Endpoints ✅
- [x] Check if user profile update endpoint exists (`PATCH /v1/users/me`) - Did not exist
- [x] Check if password change endpoint exists (`POST /v1/users/me/change-password`) - Did not exist
- [x] Review existing User model fields in Prisma schema - Only had basic fields (email, role, subscription)
- [x] Document any missing fields needed for profile management - Added: name, phone, timezone, language, theme, emailNotifications, dateFormat, timeFormat

### 1.2 Create/Update Profile Endpoints ✅
- [x] Created `PATCH /v1/users/me` endpoint for updating user profile
  - Fields: name, phone, timezone, language (email update excluded for security)
  - Updates only provided fields (partial updates supported)
  - Logs profile updates via audit log
- [x] Created `POST /v1/users/me/change-password` endpoint
  - Requires current password for verification
  - Validates new password strength (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
  - Hashes new password with bcrypt
  - Creates audit log entry for password changes
  - Validates password confirmation matches
- [x] Added input validation schemas in `app/schemas/user.py`
  - UserProfileUpdate: phone validation (10-15 digits), timezone validation (pytz)
  - ChangePasswordRequest: password strength validation, confirmation matching
  - UserPreferencesUpdate: theme, emailNotifications, dateFormat, timeFormat
- [x] Added proper error handling and responses (HTTPException with appropriate status codes)

### 1.3 Create Preferences Endpoints ✅
- [x] Added preference fields to Prisma User model (not separate table)
  - theme (light/dark/system), emailNotifications, dateFormat, timeFormat
- [x] Created `GET /v1/users/me/preferences` endpoint
  - Returns current user preferences with defaults
- [x] Created `PATCH /v1/users/me/preferences` endpoint
  - Fields: theme, emailNotifications, dateFormat, timeFormat
  - Partial updates supported
  - Pattern validation for enum values
- [x] Added preference schemas in `app/schemas/user.py`
  - UserPreferencesResponse with field aliases for camelCase

- Note: Full integration testing requires valid frontend token (token expiration issues in CLI testing)

**Actual Time:** ~3.5 hours
**Dependencies:** None

**Implementation Summary:**
1. Updated Prisma schema with profile and preference fields
2. Ran `prisma db push` and `prisma generate` to sync database

- [x] Stripe subscription endpoints exist (`app/api/subscriptions.py`)
- [x] Review Stripe service methods for completeness

**Stripe Service Review Complete:**
- ✅ Customer creation and management
- ✅ Checkout session creation (subscription and setup mode)
- ✅ Subscription lifecycle management (create, cancel, reactivate)
- ✅ Payment method management
- ✅ Invoice retrieval
- ✅ Webhook verification and event processing
- ✅ All major Stripe operations covered

### 5.2 Configure Stripe Environment Variables
**Current Status:** Environment variables configured but empty in `.env` files

**Step-by-Step Setup Guide:**

#### Step 1: Create Stripe Account & Get API Keys
- [ ] Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and create an account (or log in)
- [ ] Navigate to **Developers → API Keys**
- [ ] Copy the following keys:
  - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_`) - Used in frontend
  - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_`) - Used in backend
  - Click "Reveal test key" to see the secret key

#### Step 2: Create Product and Pricing
- [ ] Go to **Products** in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Click **"Add Product"**
- [ ] Fill in product details:
  - Name: `RevRX Pro` (or your preferred name)
  - Description: `Post-facto coding review with AI-powered recommendations`
  - Pricing: Recurring
  - Billing period: Monthly
  - Price: `$99` (or your preferred price)
  - Currency: USD
- [ ] Click **"Save product"**
- [ ] Copy the **Price ID** (starts with `price_`)

#### Step 3: Install Stripe CLI (for webhook testing)
```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe

# Verify installation
stripe --version

# Login to your Stripe account
stripe login
```

#### Step 4: Start Stripe Webhook Listener (Local Development)
```bash
# In a separate terminal, run:
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/webhooks/stripe

# This will output a webhook signing secret (starts with whsec_)
# Copy this secret for the next step
```

#### Step 5: Update Backend Environment Variables
Edit `/Users/alexander/code/revrx/backend/.env`:
```bash
# Stripe Configuration (TEST MODE)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE
STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY=price_YOUR_PRICE_ID_HERE
```

#### Step 6: Update Frontend Environment Variables
Edit `/Users/alexander/code/revrx/.env.local`:
```bash
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

# Stripe Configuration (TEST MODE)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE

# Application Settings
NODE_ENV=development
```

#### Step 7: Restart Services
```bash
# Restart backend (Ctrl+C and restart uvicorn)
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Restart frontend (in another terminal)
npm run dev
```

**Security Notes:**
- ⚠️ Never commit `.env` files to version control
- ⚠️ Use test keys (prefixed with `test_`) for development
- ⚠️ Production keys should be stored in secure environment variables
- ⚠️ Webhook secrets are sensitive - treat them like passwords

### 5.3 Test Stripe Integration

#### Pre-Testing Checklist
- [ ] Backend server running on `localhost:8000`
- [ ] Frontend server running on `localhost:3000`
- [ ] Stripe CLI webhook listener running (in separate terminal)

**Use these for edge case testing!**

#### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Webhook not receiving events**
```bash
# Check webhook listener is running
ps aux | grep stripe

# Check endpoint is correct
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/webhooks/stripe

# Check backend logs for webhook processing errors
tail -f backend_logs.log
```

**Issue: Checkout session creation fails**
- Verify `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_MONTHLY` is correct
- Check that product is active in Stripe Dashboard
- Verify API keys are correct (test mode vs live mode)

**Issue: Database not updating**
- Check webhook events are being received
- Check backend logs for errors
- Verify webhook secret is correct
- Ensure Prisma migrations are up to date: `cd backend && npx prisma migrate dev`

### 5.4 Frontend Stripe Integration ✅

**Current Status:**
- ✅ `.env.local` file exists at `/Users/alexander/code/revrx/.env.local`
- ⚠️ Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` variable
- ✅ Subscription page exists at `/subscription`

**Actions Required:**
- [ ] Add Stripe publishable key to `/Users/alexander/code/revrx/.env.local`:
  ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
  ```
- [ ] Restart Next.js dev server after adding environment variable
- [ ] Navigate to `/subscription` page to test
- [ ] Verify all buttons and flows work correctly
- [ ] Check browser console for any Stripe-related errors

**Frontend Environment Configuration:**
The frontend needs the Stripe publishable key to initialize the Stripe SDK and create checkout sessions. This key is safe to expose in the browser (it's public by design).

**Testing Frontend:**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/subscription`
2. Should see subscription status and available plans
3. "Start 7-Day Trial" button should work (creates trial in database)
4. "Subscribe Now" button should redirect to Stripe Checkout
5. After successful payment, should redirect back to success URL
6. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

**Estimated Time:** 1 hour (mostly configuration and testing)
**Dependencies:** Backend configuration complete (5.2)
