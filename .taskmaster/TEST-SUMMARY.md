## Running the Tests

### Backend Tests

```bash
# Run all backend tests
cd backend
python -m pytest tests/

# Run integration tests only
python -m pytest tests/integration/

# Run HIPAA compliance tests
python -m pytest tests/compliance/

# Run performance tests
python -m pytest tests/performance/ -m performance

# Run without slow tests
python -m pytest tests/ -m "not slow"

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
# Run all frontend tests
npm test

# Run integration tests only
npm test -- bulk-upload.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test:watch
```

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Upload Performance
- **10 files**: < 30 seconds (sequential), < 10 seconds (parallel)
- **50 files**: < 2 minutes
- **Average per file**: < 3 seconds

### Duplicate Detection
- **With 50 existing files**: < 500ms
- **With 100 existing files**: < 200ms (with index)

### Hash Computation
- **1KB file**: < 10ms
- **100KB file**: < 50ms
- **1MB file**: < 100ms
- **5MB file**: < 200ms (streaming)

### Concurrent Users
- **5 users × 10 files each**: < 60 seconds total

### Database Queries
- **Batch status (20 files)**: < 1 second
- **Duplicate check (indexed)**: < 200ms

---

## HIPAA Compliance Verification

### ✅ PHI Protection
- File hashes are one-way (SHA-256) - cannot extract PHI
- Duplicate detection uses only non-PHI metadata
- File content stored in encrypted S3, not database
- User isolation prevents cross-user PHI exposure

### ✅ Audit Trail
- Duplicate detection events logged
- Upload actions tracked with timestamps
- File handling decisions recorded (Skip, Replace, Process as New)

### ✅ Minimum Necessary
- Database stores only metadata (filename, size, hash)
- PHI content only in S3 with encryption
- Duplicate responses limited to allowed fields

### ✅ Access Control
- Users can only access their own files
- Batch status queries user-scoped
- Duplicate checks isolated by user_id

---

## Test Coverage Summary

### Backend Coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 20+ test cases
- **HIPAA Compliance**: 15+ test cases
- **Performance Tests**: 15+ test cases
- **Total**: 50+ comprehensive test cases

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### To Be Implemented
- [ ] "Replace" duplicate handling (delete old encounter, create new)
- [ ] Batch grouping UI in encounters list
- [ ] Filter encounters by batch_id
- [ ] S3 storage organization verification tests

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Rate limiting tests for bulk uploads
- [ ] Large batch size limit enforcement (50 file recommendation)
- [ ] Real-time progress updates via WebSockets
- [ ] Retry mechanism for failed uploads

---

## Test Maintenance

### When to Update Tests

1. **Schema Changes**: Update fixtures and test data
2. **New Endpoints**: Add integration test cases
3. **Performance Degradation**: Adjust benchmarks
4. **HIPAA Requirements**: Update compliance tests

### Test Data Management

- Sample clinical notes in `conftest.py`
- Test users auto-created and cleaned up
- Database state reset between tests
- S3 mock or test bucket usage

## Conclusion

The bulk upload feature has comprehensive test coverage across:
- ✅ Integration testing (backend & frontend)
- ✅ HIPAA compliance verification
- ✅ Performance benchmarking
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases

All tests are automated and can be run in CI/CD pipelines for continuous validation.
