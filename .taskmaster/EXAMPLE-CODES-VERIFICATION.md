## Expected LLM Behavior

Based on the prompt templates and test cases, the LLM should:

1. **Extract billed codes** from clinical notes and provider input
2. **Analyze documentation quality** and identify missing elements
3. **Assess denial risk** for each code based on documentation support
4. **Calculate RVUs** for billed vs suggested codes
5. **Recommend modifiers** when procedures performed same day as E/M
6. **Identify uncaptured services** documented but not billed
7. **Generate audit-ready** structured output with justifications

### Risk Levels
- **Low:** Well-supported, minimal denial risk
- **Medium:** Some documentation gaps, moderate risk
- **High:** Significant gaps, likely denial

### Priority Levels
- **High:** Immediate action needed, significant revenue impact
- **Medium:** Should address, moderate impact
- **Low:** Optional improvement, minimal impact

## Next Steps for OpenAI Integration

To run actual OpenAI API calls:

1. ✅ Prompts are ready and verified
2. ✅ Response structure is defined
3. ⏳ Implement OpenAI service integration (Track C)
4. ⏳ Add response parsing logic
5. ⏳ Validate actual LLM outputs against expected results
6. ⏳ Tune prompts based on real responses

### Required for Live Testing
- OpenAI API key configured
- OpenAI service implementation complete
- Response parser for all 7 features
- Error handling for API failures
- Token usage monitoring
