# Parallel Implementation Tracks

**Source:** `feature-expansion-tasks.md`
**Created:** 2025-10-03
**Purpose:** Organize tasks into parallel tracks for concurrent development

This document reorganizes the feature expansion tasks into parallel tracks that can be worked on simultaneously by different developers or in parallel coding sessions.

## Resource Allocation

### Optimal Team Composition
- **1x Backend/Prompt Engineer** → Track A
- **1x Backend/TypeScript Developer** → Track B → Track C
- **1x Frontend Developer** → Track D
- **1x Frontend Developer** → Track E
- **1x Full-stack Developer** → Track F
- **1x QA Engineer** → Track G (continuous)

### Solo Developer Approach
If working alone, follow this sequence:
1. Complete Track A + B in parallel (context switching)
2. Complete Track C
3. Complete Track D
4. Complete Track E
5. Complete Track F
6. Complete Track G

**Estimated Total Time (Solo):** 4-6 weeks

### Two Developer Approach
- **Developer 1:** Track A → Track C → Track F → Track G (Backend focus)
- **Developer 2:** Track B → Track D → Track E → Track G (Frontend focus)

**Estimated Total Time (Pair):** 2-3 weeks

## Critical Path Analysis

```
Track A (Prompts) ────────┐
                          ├──→ Track C (API) ────┐
Track B (Schemas) ────────┘                       ├──→ Track G (Testing) → DONE
                                                  │
Track D (Quality UI) ─────────────────────────────┤
Track E (Revenue UI) ─────────────────────────────┤
Track F (Export) ─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Critical Path:** Track A → Track C → Track G (Integration) → Track G (E2E)
**Estimated Duration:** 12-18 days with optimal parallelization

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Dependency Risks
- **Risk:** Track C blocked waiting for Track A/B
  - **Mitigation:** Use mock schemas/prompts for Track C to start development

- **Risk:** UI tracks blocked waiting for API
  - **Mitigation:** Use mock API responses to develop UI independently

### Integration Risks
- **Risk:** LLM responses don't match expected schema
  - **Mitigation:** Extensive prompt testing in Track A with schema validation

- **Risk:** Performance issues with all features enabled
  - **Mitigation:** Early performance testing in Track C, lazy loading in Track D/E

### Resource Risks
- **Risk:** Developer availability changes
  - **Mitigation:** Maintain good documentation, modular code for easy handoff

## Notes

- Tracks can be assigned to different developers or worked sequentially
- Frontend tracks (D, E) are highly parallelizable
- Track G should run continuously as each track completes
- Consider daily standups to sync progress across tracks
- Use feature flags to deploy tracks incrementally
