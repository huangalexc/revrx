# HIPAA-Compliant File Upload Implementation Tasks

**Goal**: Implement HIPAA-compliant clinical note processing where PHI is detected, redacted, and original notes are deleted immediately after processing.

**Reference**: `/Users/alexander/code/revrx/scripts/hipaa.txt`

---

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Completed
- User authentication with JWT tokens
- File upload endpoint (`POST /api/v1/encounters/upload-note`)
- Text extraction from PDF, TXT, DOCX files
- Prisma database schema with Encounter, UploadedFile, PhiMapping models
- S3 storage service infrastructure (with local dev fallback)
- Basic file validation and sanitization
- Comprehend Medical service initialized (`app/services/comprehend_medical.py`)
- PHI handler service exists (`app/services/phi_handler.py`)

### ⚠️ Issues Found
1. Upload endpoint currently has database field naming issues (Prisma camelCase vs snake_case)
2. S3 storage skipped for local dev - need proper AWS credentials or local S3 mock
3. No PHI detection/redaction in upload flow
4. Original files not being deleted after processing
5. Extracted text stored in memory but not persisted securely
6. No background task processing for PHI detection
7. AuditLog creation has field naming issues

    - `phiDetected`: true
    - `phiEntityCount`: 5
  - ✅ Test results: "Patient [NAME_2] (DOB: [DATE_2], MRN: [ID_1])" - PHI successfully redacted

### Phase 3: Delete Original Files (HIPAA-CRITICAL) ✅ COMPLETED

  - ✅ Generates ICD-10 and CPT code suggestions with justifications and confidence scores

- [x] **Task 4.2**: Create Report model record ✅
  - ✅ Report created after PHI redaction and coding analysis (line 167-179)
  - ✅ Fixed Prisma field reference: uses `encounterId` instead of relation connect
  - ✅ Fixed JSON type handling: wrapped arrays with `Json()` for proper Prisma compatibility
  - ✅ Fixed enum usage: imported and used `enums.EncounterStatus` for PROCESSING/COMPLETED/FAILED states

- ✅ PHI Detection: PhiMapping created successfully
- ✅ Report Generation: Report created with 5 suggested codes
- ✅ AI Model: gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18
- ✅ Complete Workflow: Upload → PHI Detection → Redaction → OpenAI Analysis → Report Creation → File Deletion

**Key Fixes Applied**:
1. Prisma enum usage: `enums.EncounterStatus.PROCESSING` instead of string "PROCESSING"
2. JSON field handling: `Json([])` wrapper for empty arrays to satisfy Prisma validation
3. Field reference: `encounterId` direct field instead of `encounter` relation connect

### Phase 5: Audit Logging (HIPAA-REQUIRED) ✅ **COMPLETED**

  - ✅ Supports filtering by: user, action, resource type/ID, date range
  - ✅ Registered router in `app/api/v1/router.py`

**Implementation Details**:
- Fixed Prisma JSON field handling by wrapping all JSON values with `Json()` wrapper
