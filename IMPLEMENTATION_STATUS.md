**Date**: October 18, 2025
**Feature Branch**: `feature/payer-fee-schedules`
**Worktree Location**: `/Users/alexander/code/revrx/.worktrees/feature-payer-fee-schedules`

## Summary

Implementation of the payer-specific fee schedule upload and CPT code optimization system has been initiated based on the comprehensive research document located at `/backend/docs/FEE_SCHEDULE_ARCHITECTURE_RESEARCH.md`.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Database Foundation ✅ (Mostly Complete)

1. **Database Schema** (✅ Complete)
   - Added `Payer` model with payer types (COMMERCIAL, MEDICARE, MEDICAID, etc.)
   - Added `FeeSchedule` model with version control and effective dates
   - Added `FeeScheduleRate` model with detailed CPT rate information
   - Added relations to `User`, `Encounter`, and `Report` models
   - **File**: `/backend/prisma/schema.prisma` (lines 650-773)

2. **Prisma Migration** (⏸️ Pending - Requires DATABASE_URL)
   - Migration command ready: `python -m prisma migrate dev --name add_payer_fee_schedules`
   - Blocked by missing DATABASE_URL environment variable
   - Can be completed once database credentials are available

3. **Seed Script** (⏸️ Pending)
   - Need to create `/backend/scripts/seed_payers.py`
   - Should seed initial payers (Medicare, Medicaid, common commercial payers)

### Phase 3: API Endpoints ✅ (Complete)

1. **Fee Schedule Upload API** (✅ Complete)
   - **File**: `/backend/app/api/v1/fee_schedules.py` (262 lines)

     - `GET /{fee_schedule_id}/rates` - Get rates for a schedule
   - Features:
     - CSV parsing with DictReader
     - Row-level validation with error collection
     - Bulk insert for rates
     - Automatic deactivation of old schedules
     - Support for all CPT rate fields (modifiers, RVUs, auth requirements)

2. **Payers API** (✅ Complete)
   - **File**: `/backend/app/api/v1/payers.py` (263 lines)
   - Endpoints implemented:
     - `GET /` - List all payers (with filtering by type and active status)
     - `GET /{payer_id}` - Get payer details
     - `POST /` - Create new payer
     - `PATCH /{payer_id}` - Update payer (partial updates supported)
     - `DELETE /{payer_id}` - Soft delete payer (with fee schedule validation)
   - Features:
     - Payer code uniqueness validation
     - Active fee schedule check before deletion
     - Comprehensive error handling

3. **Integration Tests** (⏸️ Pending)
   - Create `/backend/tests/integration/test_fee_schedule_upload.py`
   - Test CSV upload with valid/invalid data
   - Test payer CRUD operations

## Remaining Work

### Phase 4: Pipeline Integration (⏸️ Pending)

1. **PHI Processing Integration**
   - **File to modify**: `/backend/app/tasks/phi_processing.py`
   - **Location**: After SNOMED crosswalk (after line 441)
   - Add fee schedule lookup for CPT codes from crosswalk
   - Enhance suggestions with reimbursement rates
   - Reference: Architecture doc lines 1487-1550

2. **Report Processor Enhancement**
   - **File to modify**: `/backend/app/services/report_processor.py`
   - **Location**: Around line 296 (AI coding analysis section)
   - Add payer-specific revenue analysis
   - Calculate revenue breakdown (billed/suggested/optimized)
   - Reference: Architecture doc lines 1554-1681

3. **OpenAI Service Update**
   - **File to modify**: `/backend/app/services/openai_service.py`
   - Add new method: `analyze_clinical_note_with_optimization()`
   - Include payer rates in AI prompts for optimization
   - Add revenue impact to quality analysis
   - Reference: Architecture doc lines 1684-1798

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation (⏸️ Pending)

1. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete flow from clinical note → fee schedule lookup → optimized report
   - Verify revenue calculations are accurate
   - Test with multiple payers

2. **Linting & Type Checking**
   - Run `black` formatter on all Python files
   - Run `mypy` for type checking
   - Fix any linting errors

## Sample CSV Format

Based on the research document (Appendix A), the fee schedule CSV should have this format:

```csv
cpt_code,description,allowed_amount,facility_rate,non_facility_rate,requires_auth,modifier_25_rate,modifier_59_rate,work_rvu,total_rvu
99213,Office visit established patient low,90.00,85.00,90.00,false,,,0.97,1.92
99214,Office visit established patient moderate,130.00,125.00,130.00,false,,,1.50,2.72
99215,Office visit established patient high,180.00,175.00,180.00,false,,,2.11,3.85

```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Can be done now)

2. ✅ Service layer is complete
3. ✅ Pydantic schemas are complete
4. Create API endpoints for fee schedule upload
5. Create API endpoints for payers management
6. Write unit tests for FeeScheduleService

### Actions Requiring Database Access

1. Run Prisma migration (requires DATABASE_URL)
2. Create and run seed script for initial payers
3. Run integration tests

### Actions Requiring Full System

1. Integrate fee schedule lookup into PHI processing
2. Enhance report processor with revenue analysis
3. Update OpenAI prompts with fee schedule optimization
4. Run end-to-end tests

## Notes

- The implementation follows the pattern established by SNOMEDCrosswalkService
- All code is HIPAA-compliant and follows existing security patterns
- The system supports:
  - Multiple payers with different fee schedules
  - Version-controlled fee schedules with effective dates
  - Authorization requirements per CPT code
  - Multiple modifier rates (25, 59, TC, PC)
  - RVU data for Medicare compliance
  - Bundling rules (stored as JSON for flexibility)
