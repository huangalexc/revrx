## Integration Points

### Type Definitions
All components use TypeScript interfaces from `/src/types/analysis-features.ts`:
- `RevenueComparison`
- `ModifierSuggestion`
- `UncapturedService`

### Validation
Components expect data validated by Zod schemas from `/src/lib/schemas/analysis-features.ts`:
- `revenueComparisonSchema`
- `modifierSuggestionSchema`
- `uncapturedServiceSchema`

### Styling
- **UI Library:** Hero UI (NextUI fork)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with custom dark mode classes
- **Icons:** Lucide React (AlertCircle, MapPin, DollarSign, FileText, Info, ExternalLink)

### Future Integration
Components are ready to be imported into:
1. Review results page (after analysis completion)
2. Dashboard widgets (aggregate view)
3. Export reports (PDF/CSV generation)

---

## Dark Mode Implementation

All components support dark mode using Tailwind's `dark:` utility classes:

**Color Scheme:**
- Backgrounds: `dark:bg-gray-800`, `dark:bg-gray-900`
- Borders: `dark:border-gray-700`, `dark:border-gray-600`
- Text: `dark:text-white`, `dark:text-gray-300`
- Accents: `dark:bg-red-900/20`, `dark:bg-blue-900/30`

**Semantic Colors:**
- Success: `dark:bg-green-900/20`, `dark:border-green-800`
- Warning: `dark:bg-amber-900/20`, `dark:border-amber-800`
- Danger: `dark:bg-red-900/20`, `dark:border-red-800`
- Info: `dark:bg-blue-900/30`, `dark:border-blue-800`

---

## Accessibility Features

### Semantic HTML
- Proper heading hierarchy (h3, h4)
- Section elements for logical grouping
- Code elements for billing codes

### ARIA Support
- `sr-only` for screen reader context
- Badge content describing counts
- Tooltip descriptions for icons

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Tooltip/popover accessible via keyboard
- Accordion sections keyboard navigable

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast colors meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Focus indicators on interactive elements
- Sufficient text size and spacing
- Color is not the only indicator (icons + text)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Conditional rendering (returns null for empty data)
- Memoization candidates identified for future optimization
- No unnecessary re-renders with proper prop typing
- Efficient array operations (filter, map, sort)

### Bundle Size
- Components use tree-shakeable imports
- Icons imported individually from Lucide React
- No large dependencies

---

## Design Principles Compliance

All components adhere to `/context/design-principles.md`:

✅ **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear typography scale, proper spacing
✅ **Consistency:** Shared design tokens, pattern library usage
✅ **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first design, tested across viewports
✅ **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, keyboard navigable
✅ **Performance:** Fast render times, optimized re-renders
✅ **Error Handling:** Graceful empty states, null checks
✅ **Polish:** Smooth transitions, hover states, micro-interactions

---

## Known Limitations and Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Static Data:** Components render provided data but don't handle loading states (intentional - loading handled by parent)
2. **No Error Boundaries:** Need to wrap in ErrorBoundary when integrated (per project standards)
3. **Mock Data Only:** Not yet connected to real API endpoints (waiting on Track C completion)

### Suggested Enhancements
1. **Aggregate Dashboard:** Show totals across multiple notes
2. **Trend Analysis:** Chart revenue trends over time
3. **Export Integration:** Include in PDF/CSV exports (Track F)
4. **Interactive Filtering:** Allow users to filter by priority, code type, etc.
5. **Copy to Clipboard:** Add functionality to copy codes for billing system entry
6. **Print Optimization:** Add print-specific styles
